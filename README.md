## ## About The Project

**Live Code Collab** is a feature-rich collaborative platform built with React, Node.js, and WebSockets. This application enables multiple developers to join a shared room and code together in real-time. The goal was to create an intuitive and efficient environment that mirrors the experience of in-person pair-programming.

Key features include a synchronized code editor with remote cursors, a shared terminal for live code execution, user authentication via Firebase, and an integrated chat overlay. The entire UI is responsive and built with a modern, professional aesthetic using Tailwind CSS.
